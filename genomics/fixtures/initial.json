      "summary": "Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome is a developmental disorder that affects many parts of the body. This condition is characterized by distinctive facial features, small head size (microcephaly), intellectual disability or learning problems, and behavioral problems. Many affected children have the characteristic features of autism, a developmental condition that affects communication and social interaction. Malformations of the heart, lungs, kidneys, gastrointestinal tract, and genitalia are also common. Infants with Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome have weak muscle tone (hypotonia), experience feeding difficulties, and tend to grow more slowly than other infants. Most affected individuals have fused second and third toes (syndactyly), and some have extra fingers or toes (polydactyly). The signs and symptoms of Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome vary widely. Mildly affected individuals may have only minor physical abnormalities with learning and behavioral problems. Severe cases can be life-threatening and involve profound intellectual disability and major physical abnormalities.",

      "summary": "Cystic fibrosis is a disease in which the mucus that the body produces to protect the linings and tissue of various organs is abnormally thick and sticky. Symptoms begin soon after birth. Mucus clogs the airways, interfering with breathing, causing coughing, wheezing, inflammation, and frequent lung infections. Over time the lungs are permanently damaged, leading to the formation of cysts and scar tissue. The mucus can also build up in the pancreas, impairing the production of insulin and the release of digestive enzymes. Related symptoms include diarrhea, malnutrition, weight loss, and poor growth. Men with cystic fibrosis are usually infertile due to absence of the tubes that carry sperm to the testes (congenital absence of the vas deferens), while women may experience problems during pregnancy. Cystic fibrosis was once fatal in childhood, but improved treatments have allowed individuals with this disease to live into adulthood. CFTR-related disorders include pancreatitis, bronchiectasis, and congenital absence of the vas deferens, which can each occur isolated from the classic cystic fibrosis phenotype.",

The penetrance of FXTAS in male carriers aged 50 years and over, ascertained through families with a fragile X syndrome proband, is at least 33% (Hagerman and Hagerman, 2004); its penetrance in female carriers is approximately 5-10% (Greco et al., 2008).",
